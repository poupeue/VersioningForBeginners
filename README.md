# VersioningForBeginners
---

This shows how a project uses Semantic Versioning to label updates in the format:

vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

What the version numbers mean:

MAJOR – Big changes. Breaking compatibility.
Example: Changing how a core command works or removing features.
E.g., v1.0.0 → v2.0.0

MINOR – New features, still compatible with older versions.
Example: Adding new commands or enhancements.
E.g., v0.1.0 → v0.2.0

PATCH – Bug fixes or small improvements.
Example: Fixing a broken response or typo.
E.g., v0.1.0 → v0.1.1

Examples:

v0.0.0 – Project setup, nothing works yet

v0.1.0 – First working version

v0.1.1 – Fixed small bugs

v0.2.0 – Added new features

v1.0.0 – First full release, stable and ready for everyone
